As you may guess, if you want to write code, you will select 'Code'. This particular section is using 'Markdown', which allows you to format text for display in a web browser. Double click on this block to see the markdown used. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)\n",

For more about notebook use, read this [tutorial on notebooks](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/). You can ignore the intro about using *anaconda*, and head to the section called Creating Your First Notebook. Just for backgound, we're using something called pipenv to run notebooks for this intro, but we'll eventually come around to installing anaconda - it is a great collection of tools for wrangling/exploring data."
